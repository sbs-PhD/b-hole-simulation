# b-hole-simulation
C++ code for Schwarzschild black holes simulation.

This repository This repository was created to keep the code referenced in a paper submitted for publication in a scientific journal.

## Notes

This project uses a code for the numerical solution of differential equations of second order with 4th order Runge-Kutta method was written *C++* and for the graphics, the tools *GNUPlot* and the *Postscript*.

The simulation allowed to explore by changes in the boundary conditions, three possible geodesics for the particles: the collapse in the central singularity, the unstable orbit and the spreading to infinity.

In the compilation I used the following tools on the GNU/Linux operating system, kernel version 5.4.0-80-generic:

- GNU project C and C++ compiler, version 9.3.0
- GNUPlot 5.2 patchlevel 8
- PostScript 3

To know the C++ libraries I used check the `#include` in the source code.
