# b-hole-simulation
C++ code for Schwarzschild black holes simulation.

This repository This repository was created to keep the code referenced in a paper submitted for publication in a scientific journal.

## Introduction and notes

This project
The code for the numerical solution of differential equations of second order using 4th order Runge-Kutta method was written in *C++* and for the graphics, the tools *GNUPlot* and the *Postscript*.

The simulation allowed to explore by changes in the boundary conditions, three possible geodesics for the particles: the collapse in the central singularity, the unstable orbit and the spreading to infinity.
